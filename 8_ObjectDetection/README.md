# 8. (20 points) Object Detection (Please put the classified images as part of your submission)

### (a) (5 points) Classify the 100 images in the Store category from https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html using any image classification algorithm (not YOLO). ultralytics/yolo5

### (b) (5 points) Do the same with comparing 2 YOLO versions:

• YOLO v8 ( https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)

• YOLO v5 ( https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 )

Note: You are free to use the Ultralytics version, but I wanted to expose you to the
process for simplifying networks so you can deploy on hardware.
Discuss the differences in terms of accuracy and speed.

### (c) (10 points) Deploy a YOLO model on a Raspberry Pi. What is the effective per- formance you get on the same datasets? Build a chart of performance showing the speed (FPS) and CPU usage between your pi and the standard use computer you are using (hopefully not a pi). Note: Please add the specs of the comparison device.
